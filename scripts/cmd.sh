CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=6 python benchmarks/benchmark.py --model-name "/share/public_models/mamba-2.8b" --topp 0.9 --temperature 0.7 --repetition-penalty 1.2 --prompt "Multimodal large models are deep learning frameworks trained on massive datasets comprising multiple data types. Unlike unimodal models that focus on a single type of data, these models establish connections across various modalities, facilitating richer and more nuanced understanding. For instance, in smart cities, data streams from cameras, IoT sensors, public feedback, and traffic systems can be fused to address complex urban challenges. A key example is the integration of computer vision and natural language processing. A model that analyzes traffic footage can"
